Mongo DB README

DOCUMENTATION

http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Home

COMPONENTS

mongod - The database process.
mongos - Sharding controller (sharding available later in Q209).
mongo  - The interact javascript db shell.

BUILDING

  For detail information about building, please see:

  http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Building


- Then use scons to build.

  If you want to build everything (mongod, mongo, tools, etc):

     $ scons .

  If you only want to build the database:

     $ scons

  To install

     $ scons --prefix=/opt/mongo install

RUNNING

Run ./mongod and command line options will display.

COMPILER VERSIONS

Mongo has been tested with GCC 4.1.2 and Visual Studio 2008.  Older versions
of GCC may not be happy.

NOTES

Mongo uses memory mapped files.  If built as a 32 bit executable, you will
not be able to work with large (multi-gigabyte) databases.  However, 32 bit
builds work fine with small development databases.
